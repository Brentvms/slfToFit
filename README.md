# .slf (Sigma Log File) to .fit file converter

## Introduction

Sharing activities from Sigma ROX 11.0 to Strava has ended up cutting off rides when manual or autopause was enabled. It does not seem like Sigma is going to do anything about this, so I created this workaround to get things working again.

## How does it work?

To use this converter you need to have the Sigma Data Center (PC) and the converter downloaded. For now, the converter only works for Windows.

To convert the activity take the following steps:
1. Export the activity as .slf file from the Sigma Data Center.
2. Open the converter program.
3. Select the input file (.slf) and the ouptut path for the file (.fit)
4. Press start conversion.
5. When the file is done converting, upload the exported .fit file to Strava

**I only had limited data to test with, so always check your ride after you have uploaded it!**

When the data is not correct create an issue so I can take a look at it.

For now, only sigma ROX 11.0 is supported, but I could add extra sigma devices when the demand is there.
